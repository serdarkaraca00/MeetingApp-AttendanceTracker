# MeetingApp

MeetingApp is a .NET-based application designed to manage and track attendance for meetings and events. This app provides a user-friendly interface for attendees to report their attendance status, for organizers to view and manage participant details, and to maintain a clear record of all the meeting logistics.

## Features

- **Meeting Information**: Allows organizers to set meeting details such as location, time, and participant count.
- **Attendance Form**: An easy-to-use form for participants to submit their attendance, contact details, and participation status.
- **Participant List**: Displays a list of all participants, their attendance status, and provides a detail view for individual entries.
- **Detail View**: Offers a detailed view of each participant's information, such as name, email, and phone number.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, the user is greeted with the meeting information page. Here, the organizer can set the details of the meeting.

When the 'Apply' button is clicked, the participation form is presented for the attendee to fill in their information.

The main dashboard displays all the participants who have filled the form, highlighting those who will not attend in red for easy management.

For more details about a participant's submission, clicking the 'Detail' button next to a participant's name will provide their full information.
